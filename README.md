# Horoscopes and post-socialist countries

This is a short study using exploratory statistics based on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com) to investigate a friend's 
hypothesis to the effect that people in post-socialist countries may tend to believe in astrology and 
horoscopes more than those in non-post-socialist ones, her hypothesis being it could function as a kind of substitute for religion.

The study is presented in the Jupyter Notebook [`horosocial.ipynb`](horosocial.ipynb).
